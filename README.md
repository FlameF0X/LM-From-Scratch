# LM-From-Scratch

Inspired after [pingvortex/Learn-ML](https://github.com/pingvortex/Learn-ML)
---
You will learn how to make your own text generator arhitecture.

In comparison with `pingvortex/Learn-ML` what teaches you hoe to fine-tune a model. `LM-From-Scratch` teaches you how to make your own pre-train model from scratch!
Also the OpenAI GPT2 repo has the code to pre-train your own GPT2, it still doesn't tell you how to make your own arhitecture.

If you want you can improve the `README.md`.
