# LM-From-Scratch

A comprehensive guide to building your own language model architecture from scratch.

## Overview

This project is inspired by [pingvortex/Learn-ML](https://github.com/pingvortex/Learn-ML) but takes a different approach. While Learn-ML focuses on fine-tuning existing models, LM-From-Scratch guides you through the complete process of designing and implementing your own language model architecture.

## What Makes This Different?

- **Complete Architecture Design**: Learn how to build your own transformer-based language model from the ground up
- **Beyond Fine-tuning**: Move past just fine-tuning existing models to understanding and creating your own architectures
- **Comprehensive Learning**: Step-by-step guide through all components of a language model
- **Practical Implementation**: Real-world examples and code to help you implement your own model

## Why Build From Scratch?

While repositories like OpenAI's GPT-2 provide code for pre-training, they don't explain the architectural decisions and design principles behind building your own model. This project fills that gap by teaching you:

- How to design your own transformer architecture
- Best practices for model implementation
- Understanding the components that make up a language model
- Making architectural decisions based on your specific needs

## Getting Started

Check out the documentation in the `doc-1` directory to begin your journey in building your own language model architecture.
