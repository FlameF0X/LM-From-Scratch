## Step-by-Step: Building a Language Model from Scratch

Building a language model from scratch involves multiple steps, ranging from gathering data to training the actual model. Below is an overview of each of the core components, with links to more detailed `.md` files for deeper exploration.

### 1. Data Collection & Processing
The first step in building a language model is to gather a large and diverse text corpus that represents the language or domain the model will be trained on. Processing this data is crucial for ensuring the model learns from high-quality and well-structured text.

#### Key Tasks:
- **Data Sources:** Common sources include websites, books, research papers, news articles, and more.
- **Cleaning:** This includes removing irrelevant text, normalizing characters, handling punctuation, etc.
- **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, sentence segmentation, and chunking the text into training samples.

For an in-depth look at this step, see the [Data Collection & Processing](data-collection-processing.md) file.

### 2. Tokenization: Building the Vocabulary
Tokenization is the process of converting raw text into smaller, discrete units (tokens) that the model can work with. These tokens can be words, subwords, or even characters, depending on the tokenizer used. A well-designed vocabulary ensures efficient learning.

#### Key Tasks:
- **Choosing a Tokenizer Type:** Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), WordPiece, or Unigram models are the most common.
- **Vocabulary Size:** Deciding how many unique tokens the vocabulary will contain.
- **Handling OOV (Out-of-Vocabulary) tokens:** How the tokenizer will deal with rare or unknown words.

For a deeper dive into tokenization techniques, check the [Tokenization](tokenization.md) file.

### 3. Model Architecture Design
Once your data is prepared, it’s time to design the architecture of your model. The most popular architecture today is the Transformer, which is highly flexible and capable of handling long-range dependencies in language.

#### Key Tasks:
- **Transformer Layers:** The core unit of the architecture, including self-attention and feedforward layers.
- **Choosing the Number of Layers:** Deciding how deep your model will be, based on compute resources and desired performance.
- **Position Embeddings:** Since transformers don't have inherent sense of sequence, position embeddings are used to encode token order.

For a detailed explanation of how to design and configure your model, refer to the [Model Architecture](model-architecture.md) file.

### 4. Pre-Training Objectives
This is where the model learns the patterns of language. During pre-training, the model will use self-supervised objectives that allow it to learn from unlabeled data, which means there’s no need for manually annotated data.

#### Key Tasks:
- **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):** Used by models like BERT, where a percentage of input tokens are masked, and the model must predict them.
- **Causal Language Modeling (CLM):** Used by models like GPT, where the model predicts the next token in a sequence.
- **Other Objectives:** Examples include span corruption (T5) and permutation language modeling (XLNet).

The full explanation of pre-training objectives is in the [Pre-Training Objectives](pre-training-objectives.md) file.

### 5. Infrastructure & Training Environment
Pre-training a language model requires powerful hardware and efficient software infrastructure. Setting up the right environment is essential for training large models in a reasonable amount of time.

#### Key Tasks:
- **Choosing Hardware:** Typically involves GPUs (e.g., Nvidia A100) or TPUs, which are optimized for large-scale matrix operations.
- **Distributed Training:** Techniques like model parallelism and data parallelism help scale training to large datasets and models.
- **Mixed Precision:** Training with mixed precision (FP16) helps reduce memory usage and speed up training.

You can find further details on infrastructure setup in the [Infrastructure](infrastructure.md) file.

### 6. Optimization & Training Loop
This step is where the actual training happens. The model learns to minimize the loss function (typically cross-entropy) by adjusting its parameters through backpropagation.

#### Key Tasks:
- **Loss Calculation:** During training, the model computes how off its predictions are from the actual values.
- **Optimizer Choice:** AdamW is commonly used for optimization due to its ability to handle large learning rates and sparse gradients.
- **Training Loop:** The loop involves feeding batches of tokenized text to the model, calculating gradients, and updating the weights.

A detailed explanation of the training loop and optimization is available in the [Optimization_Training_Loop](optimization-training-loop.md) file.

### 7. Monitoring & Evaluation
Monitoring the training process ensures that the model is learning as expected and prevents overfitting. Evaluation during training helps to track the model’s progress and determine when to stop training.

#### Key Tasks:
- **Tracking Loss and Perplexity:** These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing.
- **Validation Evaluation:** Use a held-out validation set to evaluate how well the model generalizes.
- **Hardware Monitoring:** Keep an eye on memory usage, GPU utilization, and other key system metrics.
