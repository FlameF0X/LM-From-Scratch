# 01 â€” Data Preparation

## Understanding Data Requirements for Your Architecture

Before diving into implementation, it's crucial to understand how your data choices will impact your language model architecture. This section will guide you through the key decisions you need to make when preparing data for your custom architecture.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Data Format and Structure
Consider these questions when designing your data pipeline:
* What type of text will your model process? (e.g., conversations, documents, code)
* How will the structure of your data influence your architecture?
* What special tokens or markers might you need for your specific use case?

### 2. Sequence Length Considerations
Your architecture's design will be influenced by:
* Maximum sequence length requirements
* Memory constraints
* The nature of your text (e.g., short messages vs. long documents)
* Whether you need to handle variable-length sequences

### 3. Tokenization Strategy
Different tokenization approaches affect your architecture:
* Character-level: Simpler architecture but longer sequences
* Word-level: More complex vocabulary management
* Subword: Balance between vocabulary size and sequence length
* Custom tokenization: Special requirements for your use case

### 4. Data Processing Pipeline
Design decisions for your preprocessing:
* How to handle special cases (e.g., URLs, code, math)
* Whether to normalize text
* How to handle multiple languages
* Whether to implement custom preprocessing steps

## Implementation Considerations

### Memory and Performance
Your data preparation choices impact:
* Batch size capabilities
* Training speed
* Memory requirements
* Hardware requirements

### Scalability
Consider:
* How your data pipeline will scale
* Whether you need distributed processing
* How to handle large datasets
* Streaming capabilities

## Example: Making Your Own Choices

Here's a framework for making your own data preparation decisions:

1. **Define Your Requirements**
   ```python
   # Example configuration
   data_config = {
       "max_sequence_length": 512,  # Based on your needs
       "tokenization_method": "subword",  # Your choice
       "special_tokens": ["<code>", "<math>"],  # Custom tokens
       "batch_size": 32,  # Based on your hardware
   }
   ```

2. **Design Your Processing Pipeline**
   ```python
   # Conceptual example
   def custom_preprocessing(text):
       # Your custom preprocessing steps
       # This is where you implement your decisions
       pass

   def custom_tokenization(text):
       # Your custom tokenization logic
       # This is where you implement your decisions
       pass
   ```

## Next Steps

After making these decisions, you'll need to:
1. Implement your chosen preprocessing steps
2. Create your tokenization pipeline
3. Design your data loading strategy
4. Consider how these choices affect your model architecture

Remember: Your data preparation choices will directly influence your architecture design. Make these decisions carefully, considering your specific use case and requirements.

In the next section, we'll explore how to implement your tokenization strategy based on these decisions.

## Dataset: DialogMLM

For this project, we use the **DialogMLM** datasetâ€”a corpus of multi-turn dialogue examples suitable for masked language modeling. While you can use any text dataset, DialogMLM provides a clean and compact benchmark for fast iteration and experimentation.

We load the dataset using the ðŸ¤— HuggingFace Datasets library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_dataset("FlameF0X/DialogMLM")
```

## Understanding the Structure

Each sample in the dataset contains one key field:

* `text`: A string containing one or more utterances.

Example:

```json
{
  "text": "Hello, how can I help you today? I'm looking for a nearby restaurant."
}
```

## Preprocessing: Tokenization + Truncation

We prepare each text sample by applying a tokenizer with truncation and padding:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer

max_seq_len = 384

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Tokenization function
def tokenize(example):
    return tokenizer(
        example["text"],
        truncation=True,
        padding="max_length",
        max_length=max_seq_len,
        return_tensors="pt"
    )

# Apply tokenizer to the entire dataset
tokenized_ds = dataset.map(tokenize, batched=True, batch_size=24, remove_columns=["text"])
tokenized_ds.set_format("torch")
```

## Train/Validation Split

If a validation set is not provided, we manually split the training set:

```python
if "validation" in tokenized_ds:
    train_ds = tokenized_ds["train"]
    val_ds = tokenized_ds["validation"]
else:
    split = tokenized_ds["train"].train_test_split(test_size=0.1)
    train_ds = split["train"]
    val_ds = split["test"]
```

## Summary

* **DialogMLM** is used as the base dataset
* Tokenization uses `bert-base-uncased`
* Padding/truncation ensures fixed-length input
* A validation split ensures robust training

In the next section, we will build a DataLoader to feed this tokenized data efficiently into our model.
