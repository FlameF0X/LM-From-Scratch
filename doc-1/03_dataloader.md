# 03 â€” Data Loading

## Designing Your Data Loading Strategy

The data loading strategy is a critical architectural decision that affects your model's training efficiency and memory usage. This section will guide you through designing your own data loading approach.

## Key Design Considerations

### 1. Batch Processing Strategy
Consider these approaches:

**Fixed-Size Batching**
* Pros:
  * Simple implementation
  * Predictable memory usage
  * Easy to parallelize
* Cons:
  * May waste memory with padding
  * Less efficient for variable-length sequences

**Dynamic Batching**
* Pros:
  * Memory efficient
  * Better for variable-length sequences
  * Can improve throughput
* Cons:
  * More complex implementation
  * May introduce training instability
  * Harder to parallelize

**Bucket Batching**
* Pros:
  * Good balance of efficiency and simplicity
  * Reduces padding waste
  * Maintains training stability
* Cons:
  * Requires sequence length analysis
  * May need periodic rebalancing
  * More complex implementation

### 2. Memory Management
Design decisions for memory efficiency:

* **Pin Memory**
  * When to use: GPU training
  * Impact: Faster data transfer
  * Trade-off: Higher CPU memory usage

* **Prefetching**
  * When to use: Fast GPU, slow data loading
  * Impact: Reduced idle time
  * Trade-off: Higher memory usage

* **Gradient Accumulation**
  * When to use: Limited GPU memory
  * Impact: Simulates larger batch sizes
  * Trade-off: Slower training

### 3. Parallelization Strategy
Consider your hardware capabilities:

* **Number of Workers**
  * CPU-bound: More workers
  * I/O-bound: Fewer workers
  * Memory-bound: Balance workers with batch size

* **Data Sharding**
  * When to use: Distributed training
  * Impact: Parallel data loading
  * Trade-off: Increased complexity

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Design Your Batch Collation
```python
class CustomCollator:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.max_length = config.max_length
        self.padding_strategy = config.padding_strategy
        self.batching_strategy = config.batching_strategy

    def collate(self, batch):
        # Your custom collation logic
        pass
```

### 2. Design Your DataLoader
```python
class CustomDataLoader:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.batch_size = config.batch_size
        self.shuffle = config.shuffle
        self.num_workers = config.num_workers
        self.prefetch_factor = config.prefetch_factor

    def create_loader(self, dataset):
        # Your custom loader logic
        pass
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Memory Efficiency
* Batch size optimization
* Padding strategy
* Memory pinning decisions
* Worker count tuning

### 2. Speed Optimization
* Prefetching strategy
* Worker count optimization
* Sharding strategy
* Caching decisions

### 3. Quality Metrics
* Data loading throughput
* GPU utilization
* Memory usage
* Training stability

## Next Steps

After designing your data loading strategy, you'll need to:
1. Implement your collation logic
2. Set up your data loader
3. Test with your specific use case
4. Optimize for your hardware

Remember: Your data loading strategy should be designed in conjunction with your model architecture and hardware constraints. Consider the trade-offs carefully and be prepared to iterate on your design.
