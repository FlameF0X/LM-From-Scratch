# 04 â€” Model Architecture

## Designing Your Language Model Architecture

This section will guide you through the process of designing your own language model architecture. We'll explore the key components and decisions that go into creating an effective model.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### 1. Model Type Selection
Consider these fundamental approaches:

**Encoder-Only (BERT-style)**
* Pros:
  * Good for understanding tasks
  * Efficient for classification
  * Strong at feature extraction
* Cons:
  * Not designed for generation
  * Limited context window
* Best for:
  * Understanding tasks
  * Feature extraction
  * Classification

**Decoder-Only (GPT-style)**
* Pros:
  * Excellent for generation
  * Can handle long contexts
  * Good at few-shot learning
* Cons:
  * Can't see future tokens
  * May be less efficient
* Best for:
  * Text generation
  * Few-shot learning
  * Creative tasks

**Encoder-Decoder (T5-style)**
* Pros:
  * Flexible for many tasks
  * Good at transformation
  * Can handle long inputs/outputs
* Cons:
  * More complex
  * Higher memory usage
* Best for:
  * Translation
  * Summarization
  * Task-specific models

### 2. Component Design

#### Attention Mechanism
Consider these variations:
* Standard self-attention
* Sparse attention
* Linear attention
* Local attention
* Global attention

#### Positional Encoding
Choose between:
* Sinusoidal (fixed)
* Learned
* Rotary
* Relative
* ALiBi

#### Normalization Strategy
Options include:
* Layer normalization
* Pre-norm
* Post-norm
* Deep norm
* RMS norm

### 3. Architecture Scaling

#### Depth vs Width
* More layers vs wider layers
* Attention head count
* Feed-forward network size
* Embedding dimension

#### Efficiency Considerations
* Memory usage
* Computation cost
* Training speed
* Inference speed

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Design Your Base Architecture
```python
class CustomLanguageModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.model_type = config.model_type
        self.attention_type = config.attention_type
        self.normalization_type = config.normalization_type
        self.positional_encoding = config.positional_encoding
        
    def design_attention(self):
        # Your attention mechanism design
        pass
        
    def design_positional_encoding(self):
        # Your positional encoding design
        pass
        
    def design_normalization(self):
        # Your normalization strategy
        pass
```

### 2. Design Your Components
```python
class CustomAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.attention_type = config.attention_type
        self.head_count = config.head_count
        self.head_dim = config.head_dim

    def forward(self, x):
        # Your attention implementation
        pass
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Memory Efficiency
* Attention mechanism choice
* Gradient checkpointing
* Model parallelism
* Activation checkpointing

### 2. Computation Efficiency
* Attention optimization
* Feed-forward optimization
* Kernel fusion
* Quantization

### 3. Training Stability
* Normalization strategy
* Initialization method
* Learning rate scaling
* Gradient clipping

## Next Steps

After designing your architecture, you'll need to:
1. Implement your core components
2. Test your design choices
3. Optimize for your use case
4. Scale to your requirements

Remember: Your architecture should be designed based on your specific requirements and constraints. Consider the trade-offs carefully and be prepared to iterate on your design.

In the next section, we'll explore how to implement the attention mechanism you've designed.
