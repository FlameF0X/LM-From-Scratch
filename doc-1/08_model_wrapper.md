# 08 — Model Wrapper and Full Architecture

## Understanding Model Wrapper Design

The model wrapper brings together all the core components—embeddings, positional encodings, transformer blocks, normalization, and output projection—into a complete language model architecture. This section will guide you through the key design decisions and options for composing your full model.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Component Integration
Consider how to combine the following:
* **Token Embeddings**: Converts token IDs into dense vectors.
* **Positional Encodings**: Adds position information to token embeddings.
* **Stack of Transformer Blocks**: Multiple layers of attention and feedforward.
* **Final Normalization**: Normalizes the output of the transformer stack.
* **Output Projection**: Maps transformer output to vocabulary logits.
* **Weight Tying**: Shares weights between input embeddings and output projection for parameter efficiency.

#### Integration Strategies
* Sequential composition (standard)
* Parallel or interleaved components
* Custom routing or gating between components

### 2. Extensibility and Modularity
* How easy is it to swap out or extend components (e.g., custom embeddings, advanced positional encodings)?
* Can you add features like adapters, memory modules, or custom output heads?

### 3. Efficiency and Scalability
* Memory usage (e.g., weight tying, efficient parameterization)
* Computation cost (e.g., fused operations, batch processing)
* Support for large-scale models (e.g., model parallelism)

### 4. Saving, Loading, and Compatibility
* How will you save and load model weights and configuration?
* Will your model be compatible with external frameworks (e.g., HuggingFace Transformers)?

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Design Your Model Wrapper Base
```python
class CustomModelWrapper(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.embeddings = config.embeddings
        self.positional_encoding = config.positional_encoding
        self.transformer_blocks = config.transformer_blocks
        self.normalization = config.normalization
        self.output_projection = config.output_projection
        self.weight_tying = config.weight_tying
        # Additional extensibility hooks
        
    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask=None):
        # Compose embeddings, positional encodings, transformer blocks, etc.
        pass
    
    def save_pretrained(self, save_dir):
        # Your saving logic
        pass

    def load_pretrained(self, load_dir):
        # Your loading logic
        pass
```

### 2. Design Your Component Composition
```python
class ModelComponents:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.embeddings = config.embeddings
        self.positional_encoding = config.positional_encoding
        self.transformer_blocks = config.transformer_blocks
        self.normalization = config.normalization
        self.output_projection = config.output_projection

    def compose_model(self):
        # Your model composition logic
        pass
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Memory Efficiency
* Weight tying
* Efficient parameterization
* Gradient checkpointing

### 2. Computation Efficiency
* Fused operations
* Batch processing
* Hardware optimization

### 3. Extensibility
* Modular design for easy extension
* Hooks for custom components

## Next Steps

After designing your model wrapper, you'll need to:
1. Implement your component composition
2. Test different integration strategies
3. Optimize for your use case
4. Validate performance

Remember: Your model wrapper should be designed based on your specific requirements and constraints. Consider the trade-offs carefully and be prepared to iterate on your design.

In the next section, we'll explore how to implement the training loop for your full model architecture.
