# 06 â€” Designing Your Feedforward Network

## Understanding Feedforward Design

The feedforward network is a crucial component that enables your model to learn complex transformations of token representations. This section will guide you through designing your own feedforward network.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Network Architecture
Consider these fundamental approaches:

**Standard Two-Layer MLP**
* Pros:
  * Simple implementation
  * Well-understood behavior
  * Good for most tasks
* Cons:
  * Limited expressiveness
  * Fixed capacity
* Best for:
  * General purpose models
  * When computation is constrained
  * When model size is limited

**Multi-Layer MLP**
* Pros:
  * More expressive
  * Can learn complex patterns
  * Flexible capacity
* Cons:
  * More parameters
  * Harder to train
* Best for:
  * Complex tasks
  * When model size isn't constrained
  * When you need more expressiveness

**Gated Networks**
* Pros:
  * Better gradient flow
  * More stable training
  * Can learn to skip layers
* Cons:
  * More complex
  * Additional parameters
* Best for:
  * Deep networks
  * When training stability is crucial
  * When you need adaptive computation

### 2. Activation Function Selection

#### Common Choices
Consider:
* GELU
* ReLU
* SiLU/Swish
* Mish
* Custom activations

#### Design Considerations
* Gradient flow
* Computational efficiency
* Training stability
* Hardware compatibility

### 3. Dimension Design

#### Width Considerations
* Input dimension
* Hidden dimension
* Output dimension
* Expansion ratio

#### Depth Considerations
* Number of layers
* Layer distribution
* Skip connections
* Residual paths

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Design Your Feedforward Base
```python
class CustomFeedForward(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.architecture_type = config.architecture_type
        self.activation_type = config.activation_type
        self.dimension_config = config.dimension_config
        
    def design_layers(self):
        # Your layer design
        pass
        
    def design_activation(self):
        # Your activation design
        pass
        
    def design_connections(self):
        # Your connection design
        pass
```

### 2. Design Your Network Components
```python
class NetworkComponents:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.layer_count = config.layer_count
        self.activation_type = config.activation_type
        self.connection_type = config.connection_type
        
    def build_network(self):
        # Your network building logic
        pass
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Memory Efficiency
* Layer width optimization
* Activation memory usage
* Gradient checkpointing
* Parameter sharing

### 2. Computation Efficiency
* Activation function choice
* Layer fusion
* Hardware optimization
* Parallel computation

### 3. Training Stability
* Initialization strategy
* Gradient flow
* Regularization
* Layer normalization

## Next Steps

After designing your feedforward network, you'll need to:
1. Implement your network architecture
2. Test different configurations
3. Optimize for your use case
4. Validate performance

Remember: Your feedforward network should be designed based on your specific requirements and constraints. Consider the trade-offs carefully and be prepared to iterate on your design.

In the next section, we'll explore how to combine your attention and feedforward components into a complete transformer block.
