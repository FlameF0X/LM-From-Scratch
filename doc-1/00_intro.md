## Building a Language Model From Scratch

Language models are the foundation of modern natural language processing. Whether you're working with search engines, chatbots, or document understanding systems, language models provide the ability to interpret, generate, and transform text in meaningful ways.

This repository, **LM-From-Scratch**, is designed to help you **understand and implement** a complete text generation model architecture from scratch, with PyTorch and HuggingFace compatibility. You won’t just learn to use models—you’ll learn how they are structured and how to build your own.

We’ll take you through every stage of the process:

1. **Dataset processing**
2. **Tokenization strategy**
3. **Efficient data loading**
4. **Custom model architecture**
5. **Training loop with memory optimizations**
6. **Evaluation and export**
7. **Compatibility with popular libraries**

The code examples in this series are centered around an implementation called **Open-SnowflakeCore** and **SnowflakeCore-G0-R** series, a compact, efficient encoder-only model trained on a custom dataset called **DialogMLM**. You can use this architecture as a blueprint to develop more advanced models.

## Why Build Your Own Model?

While pretrained models like BERT, GPT, and LLaMA are widely available, building one yourself provides key insights into:

* Architectural tradeoffs
* Memory-performance optimizations
* Transformer internals
* Reproducible research workflows

Whether you're a student, researcher, or engineer, this guide is intended to equip you with the knowledge to:

* Experiment with new architectures
* Build lightweight models for specialized tasks
* Understand production-grade training setups

Let’s get started with preparing the dataset.
