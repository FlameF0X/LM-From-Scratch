# 05 â€” Designing Your Attention Mechanism

## Understanding Attention Design

Attention is the core component that allows your model to understand relationships between tokens. This section will guide you through designing your own attention mechanism.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Attention Type Selection
Consider these fundamental approaches:

**Standard Self-Attention**
* Pros:
  * Full token interaction
  * Well-understood behavior
  * Good for most tasks
* Cons:
  * Quadratic complexity
  * Memory intensive
* Best for:
  * General purpose models
  * When memory isn't constrained
  * When full context is needed

**Sparse Attention**
* Pros:
  * Reduced complexity
  * Memory efficient
  * Can handle longer sequences
* Cons:
  * May miss some interactions
  * More complex implementation
* Best for:
  * Long sequences
  * Memory-constrained settings
  * When local context is sufficient

**Linear Attention**
* Pros:
  * Linear complexity
  * Very memory efficient
  * Fast computation
* Cons:
  * May lose some expressiveness
  * Different training dynamics
* Best for:
  * Very long sequences
  * Real-time applications
  * When speed is critical

### 2. Attention Head Design

#### Head Count and Dimension
Consider:
* Number of attention heads
* Head dimension size
* Total model dimension
* Memory constraints

#### Head Interaction
Options include:
* Independent heads
* Cross-head communication
* Head pruning
* Dynamic head allocation

### 3. Attention Computation

#### Score Calculation
Choose between:
* Dot product attention
* Scaled dot product
* Additive attention
* Multiplicative attention

#### Masking Strategy
Consider:
* Padding masks
* Causal masks
* Local attention masks
* Custom masking patterns

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Design Your Attention Base
```python
class CustomAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.attention_type = config.attention_type
        self.head_count = config.head_count
        self.head_dim = config.head_dim
        self.masking_strategy = config.masking_strategy
        
    def compute_attention_scores(self, q, k):
        # Your attention score computation
        pass
        
    def apply_masking(self, scores, mask):
        # Your masking strategy
        pass
        
    def compute_output(self, attention_weights, v):
        # Your output computation
        pass
```

### 2. Design Your Head Management
```python
class AttentionHeadManager:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.head_count = config.head_count
        self.head_dim = config.head_dim
        self.head_interaction = config.head_interaction
        
    def manage_heads(self, attention_outputs):
        # Your head management strategy
        pass
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Memory Efficiency
* Attention pattern choice
* Head count optimization
* Memory-efficient implementations
* Gradient checkpointing

### 2. Computation Efficiency
* Fused operations
* Kernel optimization
* Parallel computation
* Hardware-specific optimizations

### 3. Training Stability
* Score scaling
* Initialization
* Gradient flow
* Attention dropout

## Next Steps

After designing your attention mechanism, you'll need to:
1. Implement your attention computation
2. Test different head configurations
3. Optimize for your use case
4. Validate performance

Remember: Your attention mechanism should be designed based on your specific requirements and constraints. Consider the trade-offs carefully and be prepared to iterate on your design.

In the next section, we'll explore how to implement the feedforward network that works with your attention mechanism.
