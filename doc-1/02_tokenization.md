# 02 â€” Tokenization

## Designing Your Tokenization Strategy

Tokenization is a crucial architectural decision that will significantly impact your language model's performance and capabilities. This section will guide you through designing your own tokenization strategy.

## Understanding Tokenization Approaches

### 1. Character-Level Tokenization
**Pros:**
* Small vocabulary size
* No out-of-vocabulary issues
* Simple implementation

**Cons:**
* Longer sequences
* Less semantic meaning per token
* More computation required

**Best for:**
* Small-scale models
* Character-level tasks
* When vocabulary is unknown

### 2. Word-Level Tokenization
**Pros:**
* Preserves word semantics
* Shorter sequences
* Intuitive representation

**Cons:**
* Large vocabulary
* Out-of-vocabulary issues
* Memory intensive

**Best for:**
* Languages with clear word boundaries
* When vocabulary is well-defined
* When memory is not a constraint

### 3. Subword Tokenization
**Pros:**
* Balance of vocabulary size and sequence length
* Handles out-of-vocabulary words
* Efficient representation

**Cons:**
* More complex implementation
* Requires training
* May split words in unintuitive ways

**Best for:**
* Large-scale models
* Multiple languages
* When memory efficiency is important

## Design Decisions

### 1. Vocabulary Size
Consider:
* Available memory
* Language characteristics
* Model size constraints
* Training data size

### 2. Special Tokens
Design your special token set:
* Start/End tokens
* Padding tokens
* Task-specific tokens
* Language-specific tokens

### 3. Tokenization Rules
Decide on:
* How to handle numbers
* Case sensitivity
* Punctuation handling
* Whitespace treatment
* Special character handling

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Define Your Tokenization Interface
```python
class CustomTokenizer:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.vocab_size = config.vocab_size
        self.special_tokens = config.special_tokens
        self.tokenization_rules = config.rules

    def tokenize(self, text):
        # Your tokenization logic
        pass

    def detokenize(self, tokens):
        # Your detokenization logic
        pass
```

### 2. Design Your Vocabulary
```python
class Vocabulary:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.token_to_id = {}
        self.id_to_token = {}
        self.special_tokens = config.special_tokens

    def build_vocabulary(self, texts):
        # Your vocabulary building logic
        pass
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Memory Usage
* Vocabulary size impact
* Token storage requirements
* Batch size limitations

### 2. Processing Speed
* Tokenization algorithm complexity
* Batch processing capabilities
* Parallel processing options

### 3. Quality Metrics
* Compression ratio
* Out-of-vocabulary rate
* Token distribution

## Next Steps

After designing your tokenization strategy, you'll need to:
1. Implement your tokenization logic
2. Build your vocabulary
3. Test with your specific use case
4. Optimize for your requirements

Remember: Your tokenization strategy should align with your model's architecture and intended use case. Consider the trade-offs carefully and be prepared to iterate on your design.

In the next section, we'll explore how to implement an efficient data loading strategy that works with your custom tokenization.
